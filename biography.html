        <p>In brief: I am a PhD Student at Rockefeller University where I study the neurogenetics of repellency in the yellow-fevr mosquito. I am mainly intersted in understanding innate behavior and decision making by combining an organismal approach with quantitative analysis. Inside of the lab I mainly debug, outside of lab I look for bugs. </p>
